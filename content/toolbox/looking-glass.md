## Looking Glass web interface
There is a public web interface available at the following address:

> https://lg.ring.nlnog.net/

Currently the ring LG uses [OpenBGPd](https://openbgpd.org/) as the BGP speaker.

## How to use the Looking Glass through SSH

With recent updates to the web-based interface, the SSH access through `lg01.infra.ring.nlnog.net` became obsolete.

## Peering with the Looking Glass
Peering with this Looking Glass is optional for ring users. If you want to peer with NLNOG RING, send [us](mailto:ring-admins@nlnog.net) your details or create a [pull-request](https://github.com/NLNOG/ring-ansible/blob/master/roles/openbgpd/vars/peers.yml), and configure a session with the following information:
