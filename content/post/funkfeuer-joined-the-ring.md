FunkFeuer Wien - Verein zur Foerderung freier Netze - AS 35492 - joined the RING today.

> FunkFeuer.at is a non-profit organization which operates a wireless mesh community network over the rooftops of Vienna and beyond. The idea behind it is to operate your own node and, in accordance with the PicoPeeringAgreement, to enable free data transit. By using the dynamic routing protocol OLSR, a network is created almost automatically, while the components remain the property of the users. We operate our own OSPF and BGP backbone for the special nodes which are connected to the internet.

Users can connect to funkfeuer01.ring.nlnog.net, which is located in Austria.
